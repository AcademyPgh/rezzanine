# rezzanine
A website for The Rezzanine, an arcade and eSports venue opening in Bridgeville, PA. Created by students of [Academy Pittsburgh] as their final project.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install` (to install the necessary node modules)
3. `npm run dev` (to start babel and webpack)
4. Serve the `/public` folder using your local web server of choice.

For step 4, we used the Live Server extension for VS Code, and this repo includes a workspace settings file to set `/public` as your root folder for Live Server.
